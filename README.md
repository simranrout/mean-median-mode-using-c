# mean-median-mode-using-c
In this program we will calculate mean,median mode of any array using c.
Algorithm 
....MEAN....
1.  calculate the sum of all number given 
2.  divide the sum with the size or the total number present in the array
3.  print answer
...MEDIAN...
1.  consider the mid point of the array if the array is odd.
2.  calculate the sum of the mid two value of the array if the array is even.now divide the sum by 2
3.  print the value.
...MODE...
1.  consider most frequent number from the array.
2. Using count and print the  most frequent number .
